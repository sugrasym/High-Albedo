description=A team of elite paper pushers and lawyers uses legal trickery to transfer ownership of a system to you. You must have built at least 4 stations in said system to initiate the transfer, and you will incur a massive standings hit to the original owner. If all of your stations in the system are destroyed, you lose ownership of the system and it returns to a different owner. Neutral space cannot be claimed this way due to a lack of laws to exploit.

description=This device takes advantage of recent discoveries made from studying the natural jumphole phenomena native to this region of space. It manipulates quantum scale holes in the universe, which occur due to vacuum fluctuations but normally close immediately, with a virtual particle field that enlarges them, then a graviton pulse that folds them into the correct shape to bridge distant points in space. It can only lock onto systems who's jump coordinates have been hashed, a process which takes many years to compute, but once computed is readily available for use by travelers.  /br/ /br/ This device was invented by the ITC to make travel easier, however your milage may vary. Initiating a jump consumes a very large amount of fuel for smaller craft, although capital sized power plants won't even bat an eye. The longer the jump, the more fuel is consumed. There are also serious safety concerns, since the exit point in the target system is random, of colliding with or even emerging inside of ships and stations. Jumping is also known to disrupt shield harmonics, and may (rarely) even cause damage to the craft itself, leading to only limited use.

description=In the 20th and 21st centuries it was theorized that one could create matter that had a negative rest mass, essentially violating some energy conditions in relativity and creating the most powerful thing in existence. This material would behave very, very, strangely in our universe and allow for things like wormholes, warp drive, and making things levitate without using power. /br/ /br/ Negative mass has been synthesized in a laboratory, but in small quantities and at extreme expense. It has vast applications making it a highly expensive and desired commodity. No natural sources are known, and the particle synthesis process to generate it is insanely expensive for most organizations. /br/ /br/ Negative mass was used to open wormholes to random locations in the universe during the Exodus project which created our civilization. Unfortunately the Exodus experiments proved that it was possible to make traversable wormholes, but impossible to target them to a specific location meaning anyone sent through would be, in all odds, lost in space forever. /br/ /br/ This variant of exotic matter also has a negative volume, since it causes space to expand in its presence. If the negative mass manages to cancel the mass of your craft, or make it negative, you will notice some interesting behavior when you collide with something.
