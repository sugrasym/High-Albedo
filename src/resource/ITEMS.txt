description=The Scimitar is a chimera of components from various factions. The hull draws inspiration from a rejected prototype blueprint for the now mass produced Gecko, but reconfigured to only cannons. The shield generator uses ITC field coils to increase recharge rate at the expense of buffer, and the thruster array has twice as many thrusters as normal, giving it impressive torque. It is primarily used by the 'Knights of Orin' as a raider.

description=In the 20th and 21st centuries it was theorized that one could create matter that had a negative rest mass, essentially violating some energy conditions in relativity and creating the most powerful thing in existence. This material would behave very, very, strangely in our universe and allow for things like wormholes, warp drive, and making things levitate without using power. /br/ /br/ Negative mass has been synthesized in a laboratory, but in small quantities and at extreme expense. It has vast applications making it a highly expensive and desired commodity. No natural sources are known, and the particle synthesis process to generate it is insanely expensive for most organizations. /br/ /br/ Negative mass was used to open wormholes to random locations in the universe during the Exodus project which created our civilization. Unfortunately the Exodus experiments proved that it was possible to make traversable wormholes, but impossible to target them to a specific location meaning anyone sent through would be, in all odds, lost in space forever. /br/ /br/ This variant of exotic matter also has a negative volume, since it causes space to expand in its presence. If the negative mass manages to cancel the mass of your craft, or make it negative, you will notice some interesting behavior when you collide with something.
