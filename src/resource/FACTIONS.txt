var_description=The Entities are an enigma. Nobody knows what they are, where they come from, or even if they are alive. However, in the last 20 years, they have been randomly attacking everyone they see. All attempts to communicate have failed, and little useful data has been obtained from destroyed ships.  /br/ /br/ Some speculate they are caretakers or guardians of the region of space humans entered via wormhole, and that they are trying to expel the alien presence. Others believe they are an alien weapon gone wrong that the modern inhabitants of the sector now have to deal with. Some conspiracy theorists believe that they were agitated or even created by the UN Preliminary Government in the early days of colonization, and therefore blame the ITC (whom they see as the direct descendents of the UN) for their presence and demand reparations and cleanup.

Many believe these newcomers to the sector will provide new insight into the nature of the Entities, since the Entities and Demons do not attack each other.

For traders, this is a nightmare. For Red Sky, this is a dream come true. Red Sky has a license to independently police anywhere in the world and collect bounties for the pirate ships they destroy. They also protect corporate interests in the border territories. Red Sky typically recruits from former military fighter pilots and civilians who want to play vigilante. Adding to their recruitment is access to their state of the art arsenal of ships designed to outrun and fight even the nastiest pirates, assuming you use them properly.

Generic weapons also don't have political strings, maintaining a sense of freedom.

var_description=After the first foundation war in 542 and the collapse of the UN Exodus Project's preliminary government three major empires were formed: The ITC, The Caina Conglemerate, and the Union Commonwealth. The Commonwealth didn't last very long.  /br/ /br/ The Commonwealth prospered for 25 years until the Commonwealth Director Antonio Costache used his extensive power as Director to begin a territorial war with the Cainans in 567 to expand the Commonwealth's influence, and hopefully acquire the exceptionally ore rich asteroids their space happened to contain.  /br/ /br/ The war was, obviously, unpopular and a revolutionary movement quickly put pressure on the Commonwealth. With these new internal problems, combined with resistance from the newly formed ITC-Cainan coalition, the Union Commonwealth entered a failure cascade and collapsed.  /br/ /br/ From the ashes rose two new nations, one being the Ageiran Federation. The Ageiran Federation retains the political structure of the former Commonwealth: a parlament with representatives from each planet and a parlament director who wields strong executive power. Their current goal is to remove the Archers pirate faction from their domain, and to remove the massive financial deficit they inherited from the former Commonwealth's Cainan campaign. This will be difficult due to renewed hostilities between the two factions, forcing periodic skirmishes along the border. The Ageirans fear that these skirmishes may escalate into a full blown war, which some are already calling the Second Foundation War.

var_description=After the collapse of the Union Commonwealth there was a period where no government could project power over the former Commonwealth territories. The Archers took advantage of this and moved from small time crime to heavily armed crime syndicate.  /br/ /br/ Originally into software piracy, they grew a few levels on the villain scale and started doing real piracy. Then they grew a little bolder and started going head to head with the Ageiran police and eventually military.  /br/ /br/ This is made possible by their retrofitted ships which are designed to stay out of firing range and slowly whittle their target's shields away. This strategy is quite effective one on one, allowing them to effectively raid.  /br/ /br/ The Archers as an organization aren't really sure what to do next, but are interested in claiming some of their own space one day.

var_description=The Exodus Project was an attempt to seed the universe with human colonies using a random wormhole generator to send people who knows where in the universe with ships and supplies to start fresh. The only problem was that it is impossible to make a return trip since you don't even know where you end up after crossing the event horizon, and even if you did the odds of getting a wormhole connection anywhere near your desired target are nearly 0.  /br/ /br/ The ITC never fought the Foundation War. They just sort on inherited their space from the UN Preliminary Government thanks to some clever dealing by Yong Jung; former Chairman of the UN Preliminary Government Special Development Projects. Ultimately, the UN Preliminary Government was doomed to collapse without the ability to travel to or even communicate with Earth. She saw the writing on the wall, and acted fast. She convinced the exodus government to transfer ownership of several solar systems at the edge of settled space to a new group called the 'Interstellar Trade Coalition', which was an economic alliance. In exchange the ITC would pay a high tribute to the UN Preliminary Government (75% of their GDP).  /br/ /br/ The Foundation War started before the ITC even had to make one payment. Today the ITC has expanded. Membership is voluntary, and the member solar systems are allowed to retain their local government as long as they comply to the ITC developmental and human rights standards. Helping the ITC grows is the fact that powerful crime syndicates and dictatorships were gobbling up unclaimed space, and the ITC was an attractive option to avoid becoming owned by such a person.  /br/ /br/ The ITC provides a standard currency, financial regulator body, and armed forces intended to secure a bright and profitable future for all member systems. This shows even today, as the ITC are the only empire without a native pirate faction. The ITC have been supportive of their Cainan allies in the recently renewed conflict, but are always seeking a peaceful resolution.

var_description=After the foundation wars, Caina formed quickly. During the war there was a General Jordon Daveth who led the fledgling Cainan Air Force to victory against impossible odds. After the war, Daveth was ascended to a Kingly role by popular demand, where he dedicated his life to securing the border territories and ensuring that the Cainan nation would endure into the far future. Even when the Union Commonwealth invaded in 567 he did not falter, and embodied the spirit of the Cainan Conglemerate of Planets.   /br/ /br/ 'Good King Daveth' succeeded, since the Cainans are still here in the year 741, which is nearly 200 years later. Since the death of his son, Daveth II, his grandson, Daveth III, has ascended to the throne in recent years. With recent concerns about growing Knights of Orin influence and crime syndicate encroachment on the border territories, and continued conflict with the two Federations, he has a lot to handle and a great legacy to live up to.

var_description=The Wolves are a powerful criminal syndicate that operates in neutral space and makes incursions into imperial space on a regular basis. Originally from the ITC, they were expelled in 605 by a coordinated ITC-Cainan campaign into the unclaimed systems. This was the best thing to ever happen to them.  /br/ /br/ The unclaimed systems at the time contained no governments or groups with the power to resist their expansion, and the Wolves were able to install local warlords to govern the region. The only competition to the Wolves are the Tengus: another criminal group of similar origins.  /br/ /br/ Wolves are involved in both traditional piracy and the illegal human organ trade, making them a dangerous group. Unlike the Tengus, they did not forge any alliances with smaller criminal groups, which has left them at a disadvantage in recent years.

Unlike the Ageirans the Orin decided to redo the government to create a headless senate with a homeland defense first policy. The Federal government collects taxes and uses them to fund national defense projects, but for defensive purposes only. The senate has no leader and all actions require 75% majority. Current goals include the end of the Knights of Orin political movement, a confused but strong movement working under the assumption that an Aztec king once ruled all of Earth, dealing with renewed hostilities with the ITC and Cainans, and cooperation with their Ageiran allies on the Archers problem.

var_description=The Knights, to external observers, are a bit confused. Motivated by the belief that the Aztec King Mufasa once ruled all of Earth and that his descendents are the rightful heirs to the universe, they are attempting to usurp the governments of the Caina Conglemerate and Orin Federation to create a new kingdom.  /br/ /br/ Of course, this is really stupid for a few reasons: 1. Mufasa was the last great African king, 2. The Knights draw their terminology from British sources, 3. The Knights believe the Aztecs not only spoke Spanish but invented it and passed it on to Europeans. Not to mention the hopelessness of the entire enterprise, considering the Orin and Cainan militaries are having no issues destroying Knights raiders.  /br/ /br/ However they do attract a certain kind of paranoid, antifederalist, and anarchist mind that gives them a massive recruiting pool. Some defenders of the organization rationalize their bizarre beliefs as symbolic and believe the Knights are interested in a better tomorrow for all people, but most people think they are crazy and all historians laugh at them for failing history forever.
